💡 Project Title
Smart Thermostat Energy Analysis: Exploring Indoor Climate & Energy Patterns

📁 Project Overview
This project analyzes smart thermostat and weather data to uncover patterns in HVAC usage, temperature control, and energy efficiency. The goal is to derive insights that help balance indoor comfort, energy cost, and environmental factors. The data includes over 40,000 records of 5-minute thermostat logs and hourly weather data collected over a 1-year period.

🎯 Project Objective
To evaluate how indoor HVAC behavior correlates with outdoor weather and usage patterns, and to identify opportunities to optimize comfort and efficiency. Key questions addressed include:

How often does the HVAC run daily?

How closely does the actual indoor temperature align with setpoints?

What is the relationship between outdoor temperature and fan runtime?

How stable is indoor comfort based on defined humidity and temperature ranges?
